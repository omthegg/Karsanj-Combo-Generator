# Karsanj-Combo-Generator

This is a Karsanj.net Username and Password generator.
If you don't know what is going on with Karsanj,
Karsanj is a website for schools to put assignments for students.
Both students and teachers have accounts.
When schools make accounts for students, they put the last 4 digits
of their username as their password.
A smart student would change their password to something more complex.
But some students don't change their password and leave it as it is.
With this script, you can generate Usernames and Passwords.
(You also have a very small chance of catching a teacher account)

You tell it how many you want and it will generate.
The usernames generated have a probability of being an actual Karsanj account.
The output will be put in two text files called "CodeList.txt" and "CodePasswordList.txt"
in the directory that you run the script in.

Pros:
It will NOT generate duplicates.
It will NOT overwrite the existing combos in the files. So you can run it as many times
as you want and all of the combos will be in one place.

Cons:
It will NOT try them on the website though.
You will need to use another tool along side this tool if you want to make sure the accounts exist.
